To setup the frontend part, This was developed by using Vite where I have include the React.js with Node version v22.17.0 and for css part used Tailwind CSS v3.47. 

Some of the Libraries or Modules which was used in various jsx pages need to be installed using npm install, npm run dev. 

In the backend I have used Java 25 LTS and for spring boot used SpringIO were I have select spring v23 

For the Database you can used any Structured Databases as per your choice but you need to configure it in the backend, I have used SQL server (SSMS) so I had to add the SQL server dependency into the pom.xml 
and also configured it in the application.properties as well.

For API testing used Postman for testing the API calls used in the project as well handled Authentication too.
